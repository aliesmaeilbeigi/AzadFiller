## About the Project

This is an extension designed to automate the process of filling out faculty evaluation forms on the Islamic Azad University system (https://stdn.iau.ir). It simplifies the repetitive and time-consuming evaluation process for students by automatically selecting the "Average" option for all questions and clicking the "Submit" and (if possible) "Back" buttons.

The project was developed to save students time, and its initial version was written in under 15 minutes with the help of artificial intelligence.

**This project was created by Ali Esmaeilbeigi with the help of Grok 3, an AI developed by xAI. Even the overall structure of this README file was written by Grok 3!**
